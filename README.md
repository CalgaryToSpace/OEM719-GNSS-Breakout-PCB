# OEM719-GNSS-Breakout-PCB
PCB to breakout the NovAtel OEM719 GNSS receiver PCB for development and testing

## Description

This PCB serves the following purposes:

* Adapts the NovAtel OEM719 GNSS receiver PCB to a standard 2.54mm pitch header.
    * The default off-the-shelf NovAtel OEM719 PCB has a 2.0mm pitch header, which is difficult for prototyping and development.
* Adapts the NovAtel OEM719 GNSS receiver PCB, without pin modifications, to the DMC3 board configuration
    * The DMC3 board requires that the NovAtel OEM719 PCB be mounted upside down, which requires a custom PCB to adapt the pinout.
